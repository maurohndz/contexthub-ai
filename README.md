**Ágora** is an open source (MIT), **self-hostable knowledge platform**
that turns an organization's scattered information — manuals, meeting
minutes, business rules, requirements, decisions, and technical
documentation — into **queryable operational context** through natural
language.

Its real product is not "chatting with documents": it is **managing
organizational context** in a traceable way, keeping full control of
data, infrastructure, and AI provider in the hands of the user.

## Why Ágora

The knowledge needed to work correctly is usually fragmented: partly in
documents, partly in meetings, and largely in the memory of a few key
people. That means slow onboarding, decisions made without context, and
knowledge that walks out the door with every departure.

> An organization's knowledge should not disappear when a person leaves,
> stay hidden inside documents, or depend on who remembers a meeting.

Ágora loads that knowledge into **projects**, retrieves the relevant
fragments for every question (RAG over pgvector), and answers **with
citations** — persisted with each reply, so answers stay verifiable
forever. When there is not enough evidence, it says so instead of
inventing context.

## Features

- 🏢 **Multi-tenant organizations** — members, projects, and AI
  credentials fully isolated per tenant.
- 📁 **Knowledge projects** — each project scopes its sources and its
  conversations.
- 📄 **Document pipeline** — PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, CSV, JSON (≤20 MB);
  background processing with text extraction, chunking, and embeddings.
- 💬 **Grounded chat** — seven task modes (explain a process, design a
  requirement, detect contradictions…), per-user conversation history per
  project, and **persisted citations** on every answer.
- ⚡ **Realtime everywhere** — document status and chat updates reach the
  UI over SSE; no polling.
- 🔒 **Privacy by structure** — self-hosted, local embeddings via Ollama
  by default, org AI keys encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) and never
  exposed over HTTP.
- 🔌 **Interchangeable AI provider** — Gemini today; a provider
  abstraction with OpenAI, Anthropic, and fully-local Ollama generation
  is [Phase 1 of the roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Node.js ≥ 20, pnpm ≥ 9, Docker + Docker Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maurohndz/contexthub-ai.git agora
cd agora
pnpm install

pnpm infra:up            # Postgres (pgvector) + Redis + Ollama — embedding model auto-pulled
pnpm db:migrate:local    # apply database migrations

pnpm dev:backend         # API    → http://localhost:3000
pnpm dev:frontend        # Web UI → http://localhost:5173
```

Then create your account, organization and first project, connect your
AI provider key, upload a document and ask. Full guide:
